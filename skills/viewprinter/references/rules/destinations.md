# destinations: One workspace, and a group is a snapshot

## Priority: CRITICAL

## What goes wrong

Three separate refusals arrive after the post is composed:

- Destinations spanning two workspaces. **A post must stay in one.**
- A group named when a member needs reconnecting. The post is refused
  **outright**, not partially — and this is the single most common reason a
  well-formed post is rejected.
- A group assumed to be a live link, so the user believes adding an account
  later will add it to a post already scheduled. It will not.

## What to do instead

Get ids from `accounts_list`, or name a group from `groups_list`. The two
combine, and duplicates across them collapse to one delivery.

**Check `groups_list` before naming a group.** It reports the state of each
member and how many need attention. Reading it costs one call; skipping it costs
the whole composition.

**A group is expanded at the moment you schedule.** It is shorthand for "these
members, now". If the user's intent is "always everyone in this group", say so
plainly rather than letting them assume it updates.

## Changing a group

`groups_update`'s `account_ids` is the **full membership afterwards, not a list
to add.** Whatever you send replaces what was there. To add one account, send
the existing members plus the new one. Omit `account_ids` entirely to rename or
re-describe without touching membership.

**Getting this wrong silently empties a group.** There is no error; the group
simply has fewer members than the user thinks.

## Context

- `groups_create` — names are unique per workspace, matched without regard to
  case, and all members must share a workspace.
- `groups_delete` removes the name and membership only. The accounts stay
  connected, and posts already scheduled through the group are unaffected,
  because a post records accounts rather than the group.
